**Design Movement**: **Swiss International Style (Ski Edition)**
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Radical Clarity**: Financial data must be instantly readable. No decorative fluff that obscures numbers.
2.  **Grid-Based Precision**: Everything aligns perfectly, reflecting the precision of accounting and the lines of ski tracks.
3.  **High Contrast**: Stark differences between background and foreground to ensure readability in bright outdoor conditions (snow glare).
4.  **Function First**: Every element must serve a purpose. If it doesn't help manage money, it goes.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Primary**: **International Orange (#FF4F00)** - High visibility, safety, urgency. Used for "You Owe" and key actions.
*   **Secondary**: **Glacial Blue (#E0F7FA)** - Represents the snow and cold environment. Used for backgrounds and "Safe/Paid" states.
*   **Neutral**: **Deep Charcoal (#1A1A1A)** - For text and structure.
*   **Intent**: To create a sense of trust and clarity. Money can be stressful; the design should be objective and reassuringly precise.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Asymmetric Balance**: Use a strong vertical axis but balance heavy data blocks with negative space.
*   **Card-Based Modularism**: Each expense or participant is a distinct card, stackable and reorderable.
*   **Typography-Driven Hierarchy**: Size and weight of text define importance, not boxes or borders.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Oversized Typography**: Total balance shown in massive, thin font.
2.  **Topographic Lines**: Subtle background patterns resembling ski maps or elevation charts.
3.  **Monospace Data**: All financial figures in a crisp monospace font for tabular alignment.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Direct Manipulation**: Swipe to settle, tap to expand.
*   **Instant Feedback**: Numbers update immediately with a satisfying "tick" animation.

**Animation**:
*   **Snap and Slide**: Transitions are quick and precise, like ski bindings snapping shut.
*   **Counter Rolling**: Numbers roll up/down like a mechanical odometer when updating.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: **Helvetica Now Display** (Bold/Black) - For impact and Swiss heritage.
*   **Body/Data**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Roboto Mono** - For financial precision.

**Design Movement**: **Neo-Brutalism / "Ski Bum" Lo-Fi**
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Raw & Unpolished**: Embraces the DIY spirit of a group trip. It feels like a zine or a flyer found in a ski lodge.
2.  **Bold Borders**: Thick, black outlines around everything.
3.  **High Saturation**: Colors that pop against the white snow.
4.  **Playful & irreverent**: Money is serious, but the trip is fun. The design should reflect the fun.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Palette**: **Neon Yellow (#FAFF00)**, **Hot Pink (#FF00D6)**, **Cyan (#00FFFF)** against **Stark White (#FFFFFF)** and **Pitch Black (#000000)**.
*   **Intent**: To reduce tension. "It's just money, let's sort it out and go ski." High energy, low stress.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Collage-Like**: Elements overlap slightly.
*   **Marquee Headers**: Scrolling text for announcements or totals.
*   **Brutal Grids**: Visible, thick grid lines separating content.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Sticker Aesthetics**: UI elements look like stickers slapped on a board.
2.  **Pixel Art Icons**: Retro ski icons (skis, beer, mountains).
3.  **Drop Shadows**: Hard, non-blurred drop shadows at 45 degrees.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Tactile Buttons**: Buttons that visibly depress (3D effect) when clicked.
*   **Exaggerated Hover**: Elements grow or shake slightly when hovered.

**Animation**:
*   **Jitter**: Subtle vibration on "urgent" items (like unpaid debts).
*   **Slide-in**: Panels slide in from off-screen with a bounce.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: **Space Grotesk** or **Chakra Petch** - Quirky, geometric.
*   **Body**: **Inter** (Bold only) - Readable but punchy.

**Design Movement**: **Japandi (Japanese + Scandinavian) Minimalism**
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Warmth & Texture**: Natural tones, paper textures, soft lighting.
2.  **Simplicity & Zen**: Only the essential information is shown.
3.  **Softness**: Rounded corners, blurred backdrops, gentle gradients.
4.  **Harmony**: Integrating the digital tool with the natural setting of Myoko.

*   **Palette**: **Warm Beige/Paper (#F5F5F0)**, **Soft Sage (#8FA89B)**, **Muted Terracotta (#C7826B)**, **Ink Blue (#2C3E50)**.
*   **Intent**: To create a calming financial experience. "Settling up" should feel like a relief, not a chore.

**Layout Paradigm**:

*   **Floating Islands**: Content containers float on a soft, textured background.
*   **Generous Margins**: Lots of breathing room around text.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Washi Tape Dividers**: Visual separators that look like torn tape.
2.  **Ink Brush Strokes**: Subtle accents for active states.
3.  **Frosted Glass**: Modals and overlays use a soft blur (snow effect).

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Fluidity**: Everything flows like water. No hard stops.
*   **Gentle Taps**: Interactions are soft and responsive.

**Animation**:
*   **Fade and Float**: Elements gently fade in and float up.
*   **Soft Glow**: Active elements pulse with a soft light.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: **Playfair Display** or **Lora** - Elegant serifs.
*   **Body**: **Satoshi** or **General Sans** - Clean, humanistic sans-serif.
